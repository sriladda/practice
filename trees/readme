what is Binary Tree?
-- Any tree, in which, every node has at the max 2 leaves only.
what is Binary Search Tree?
-- Any Binary Tree, in which, all the nodes left to the root are less than root and all the nodes right to the node are greater than root.

ok now, why BST??
-- because insert and delete are also of order(log n), unlike sorted arrays where insert and delete are O(n)
-- in linked list insert and delete are O(1) but search is order(n)

// Problems solved on trees
1. Insert in tree and print using inorder, insert.c
2. BFS, bfs.c and queue.c
3. Inorder successor and predecessor, successor_predecessor.c
4. Delete node from bst, delete_node.c

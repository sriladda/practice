what is Binary Tree?
-- Any tree, in which, every node has at the max 2 leaves only.
what is Binary Search Tree?
-- Any Binary Tree, in which, all the nodes left to the root are less than root and all the nodes right to the node are greater than root.

ok now, why BST??
-- because insert and delete are also of order(log n), unlike sorted arrays where insert and delete are O(n)
-- in linked list insert and delete are O(1) but search is order(n)

// Problems solved on trees
1. Insert in tree and print using inorder
     insert.c

2. BFS or level order traversal 
     gcc bfs.c and queue.c

3. Inorder successor and predecessor
     successor_predecessor.c

4. Delete node from bst
     delete_node.c

5. iterative inorder and preorder using stack, 
     cd iterative_DFS
     gcc inorder.c stack.c
     gcc preorder.c stack.c
     gcc postorder.c
   Did not use my stack for post order, as 2 stacks are needed and my stack needs enhancements for multi stack

6. print all possible root to leaf paths
     print_all_root_to_leaf.c

7. print each level of bfs in new level and bfs in iterative
     gcc bfs_iterative.c queue.c       

8. maxDepth or maxHeight of binary tree
     max_height.c
9. Are two given trees the same?
     is_same_tree.c
